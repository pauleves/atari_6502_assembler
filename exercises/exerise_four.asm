Start:
    LDA #100    ; Load the A register with the literal decimal value 100
    CLC
    ADC #5      ; Add the decimal value 5 to the accumulator
 
    SEC
    SBC #10     ; Subtract the decimal value 10 from the accumulator
                ; Register A should now contain the decimal 95 (or $5F in hexadecimal)

    ORG $FFFC ; End the ROM by adding required values to memory position $FFFC
    .word Start ; Put 2 bytes with the reset address at memory position $FFFC
    .word Start ; Put 2 bytes with the break address at memory position $FFFE
